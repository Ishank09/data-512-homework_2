## Steps and files (1-1 mapping)

### Step 1: Data Extraction from Wikipedia API
Source: data_extraction.ipynb

1. The initial step involves extracting data from the Wikipedia API, specifically fetching article titles and last revision IDs. The process is implemented in the data_extraction.ipynb notebook.
2. Attribution is given to the original source of the code.
3. Constants and configurations are defined, including the API endpoint, latency assumptions, and request headers.
4. A function request_pageinfo_per_article is defined to request page info for a single article from the Wikipedia API.
5. Wikipedia data is loaded from a CSV file (../data/us_cities_by_state_SEPT.2023.csv).
6. Page info is requested and stored for Wikipedia articles in a CSV file (../data/wiki_page_info.csv).
Note: The full code details and implementation can be found in the data_extraction.ipynb notebook.


### Step 2: ORES API Prediction
Source: ores_prediction.ipynb

1. The next step involves utilizing the ORES API to obtain quality predictions for the articles.
2. Constants for the ORES API are defined along with the function to make the ORES API request.
3. The code is attributed to Dr. David W. McDonald, used under the Creative Commons CC-BY license.
4. The script checks for existing entries in the CSV file (../data/ores_predictions.csv) to prevent duplicates.
5. The ORES score is obtained and stored for each article in the CSV file (ores_predictions.csv)
Note: The full code details and implementation can be found in the ores_prediction.ipynb notebook.


### Step 3: Data preprocessing
Source: data_preprocessing.ipynb

1. The script reads a CSV file containing Wikipedia articles (../data/ores_predictions.csv)
2. It extracts the titles of the articles and checks if they contain a US state name as the last word after a comma.
3. Articles not conforming to the naming convention are filtered out.
4. The script saves the cleaned data to a new CSV file ('../data/cleaned_data.csv')
Note: The full code details and implementation can be found in the data_preprocessing.ipynb notebook.


### Step 4: Data Merging
Source: data_merging.ipynb

1. Read the initial datasets ('ores_predictions.csv', 'us_cities_by_state_SEPT.2023.csv', and 'US States by Region - US Census Bureau.xlsx') containing information about ORES predictions, US cities, and US state divisions.
2. Data Integration: Combine the relevant data from the 'us_cities_by_state_SEPT.2023.csv' and 'ores_predictions.csv' datasets, utilizing the common key, and create a unified dataframe.
3. Merge the unified dataframe with the 'US States by Region - US Census Bureau.xlsx' dataset based on the shared key, resulting in a comprehensive dataset encompassing US state regional divisions, populations, and Wikipedia article details.
4. Select only the necessary columns, including 'State', 'DIVISION', 'article_title', 'Last_Revision_ID', and 'Prediction', for the final dataset to ensure relevance and coherence.
5. Rename the selected columns to enhance the readability and interpretability of the final dataset.
6. Save the processed and refined dataset as a CSV file named 'resulting_data.csv', containing a consolidated view of US state divisions, regional information, and associated Wikipedia article details.
Note: The full code details and implementation can be found in the data_merging.ipynb notebook.
